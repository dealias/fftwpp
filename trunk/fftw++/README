        FFTW++: Fast Fourier Transform C++ Header Class for FFTW3 Library

FFTW++ is a C++ header class for Version 3 of the highly optimized FFTW
(http://www.fftw.org) Fourier Transform library. It provides a simple
interface for 1D, 2D, and 3D complex-to-complex, real-to-complex, and
complex-to-real Fast Fourier Transforms and convolutions. It takes
care of the technical aspects of memory allocation, alignment, planning,
and wisdom. Wrappers for multiple 1D transforms are also provided. As with
the FFTW3 library itself, both in-place and out-of-place transforms of
arbitrary size are supported. 

Implicit dealiasing of standard and centered Hermitian convolutions is
also implemented; in 2D and 3D implicit zero-padding substantially reduces
memory usage and computation time.  For more information, see the
manuscript "Efficient Dealiased Convolutions without Padding",
by John C. Bowman and Malcolm Roberts, to appear in the SIAM Journal on
Scientific Computing, 2011:

http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~bowman/publications/dealias.pdf

Convenient optional shift routines that place the Fourier origin in the logical
center of the domain are provided for centered complex-to-real transforms
in 2D and 3D; see fftw++.h for details.

FFTW++ can also exploit the high-performance Array class available at
http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~bowman/Array (version 1.44 or higher),
designed for scientific computing. The arrays in that package do memory
bounds checking in debugging mode, but can be optimized by specifying the
-DNDEBUG compilation option (1D arrays optimize completely to pointer
operations).

Detailed documentation is provided before each class in the fftw++.h header
file. The included examples illustrate how easy it is to use FFTW in C++
with the FFTW++ header class. Use of the Array class is optional, but
encouraged. If for some reason the Array class is not used, memory should
be allocated with ComplexAlign (or doubleAlign) to ensure that the data is
optimally aligned to sizeof(Complex), to enable the SIMD extensions.
The optional alignment check in fftw++.h can be disabled with the
-DNO_CHECK_ALIGN compiler option.
